## Introduction
Welcome to the 'ETR EZ Fact Finding Board Document Generator' (EZ FFB) & Student Roster Management System.  This project is written in VB.NET almost exclusively with a few modules written in Python.  The software keeps a database of active students and allows for adding, deleting and updating student records as well as generating accurate Fact Finding Board Documents in just seconds by automatically populating documents necessary for the FFB through a local datasource as well as minimal user input in the application UI.
### Brief Overview
'EZ FFB' helps manage student rosters efficiently and provides features such as _adding, updating, and deleting_ student records.  It also has an efficient database updater that takes an active student roster from CIS and updates the database with all the necessary changes including additions and deletions as needed. 

### Problem It Solves
Managing student records can be a hassle, especially for educational centers with a large number of students. Our software streamlines this process, making it quick and error-free.

### Target Users
- Educational institutions
- Student counselors
- Administrators

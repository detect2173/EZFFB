## Creating New FFB Documents

Once you've launched the software, you'll find yourself on the Main Dashboard. Here’s how to create a new FFB Document:

### Step 1: Navigate to the 'FFB DOCS' tab

- On the left-hand sidebar, click on the "FFB DOCS" tab.

### Step 2: Fill in the Details

- You'll see various fields like 'Infraction,' 'Location,' 'Student Name,' etc.
- Begin filling out the form starting with the infraction. All the fields are required, but some are filled out automatically for you like the dates. The dates, with the exception of DOB and DOE, are editable. If you change the Board date, incident date, etc., the software makes the necessary adjustments to the relevant dates (Appeal date, etc).

  > **Note**: Default dates that are calculated are as follows:
  >
  > - **Level I Infraction**: Board dates are automatically calculated to be held on the 3rd business day following the infraction date.
  > - **Level II Infraction**: Board dates are automatically calculated for the 5th business day following the infraction date.
  > - (Feel free to edit the dates according to your needs)
